# QuickResponseC2
QuickResponseC2 is a stealthy Command and Control (C2) framework that enables indirect and covert communication between the attacker and victim machines via an intermediate HTTP/S server. All network activity is limited to uploading and downloading images, making it an fully undetectable by IPS/IDS Systems and an ideal tool for security research and penetration testing.


## Capabilities:

- **Command Execution via QR Codes**:  
  Users can send custom commands to the victim machine, encoded as QR codes.  
  Victims scan the QR code, which triggers the execution of the command on their system.  
  The command can be anything from simple queries to complex operations based on the test scenario.

- **Result Retrieval**:  
  Results of the executed command are returned from the victim system and encoded into a QR code.  
  The server decodes the result and provides feedback to the attacker for further analysis or follow-up actions.

- **Built-in HTTP Server**:  
  The tool includes a lightweight HTTP server that facilitates the victim machine’s retrieval of command QR codes.  
  Results are sent back to the server as QR code images, and they are automatically saved with unique filenames for easy management.  
  The attacker’s machine handles multiple requests, with HTTP logs organized and saved separately.

- **Stealthy Communication**:  
  QuickResponseC2 operates under the radar, with minimal traces, providing a covert way to interact with the victim machine without alerting security defenses.  
  Ideal for security assessments or testing command-and-control methodologies without being detected.

- **File Handling**:  
  The tool automatically saves all QR codes (command and result) to the `server_files` directory, using sequential filenames like `command0.png`, `command1.png`, etc.  
  Decoding and processing of result files are handled seamlessly.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:  
  The tool is operated via a simple command-line interface, allowing users to set up a C2 server, send commands, and receive results with ease.  
  No additional complex configurations or dependencies are needed.


## Usage

1. First, install the Dependencies -
   `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Then, run the main.py
   `python3 main.py`
3. Choose between the options:
   
   1 - Run the C2 Server
   
   2 - Build the Victim Implant
   
5. Enjoy!

## Workflow Overview

### 1. **Initialization of the C2 Server**
- The attacker launches QuickResponseC2, which creates a lightweight HTTP server (default port: `8080`).
- This server serves as the intermediary between the attacker and victim, eliminating any direct connection between them.

---

### 2. **Command Delivery via QR Codes**
- The attacker encodes a command into a QR code and saves it as `commandX.png` on the HTTP server.
- The victim machine periodically polls the server (e.g., every 1 second) to check for the presence of a new command file.

---

### 3. **Victim Command Execution**
- Once the victim detects a new QR code file (`commandX.png`), it downloads and decodes the image to retrieve the command.
- The decoded command is executed on the victim’s system.

---

### 4. **Result Encoding and Uploading**
- The victim encodes the output of the executed command into a QR code and saves it locally as `resultX.png`.
- The result file is then uploaded to the HTTP server.

---

### 5. **Result Retrieval by the Attacker**
- The attacker periodically checks the server for new result files (`resultX.png`).
- Once found, the result file is downloaded and decoded to retrieve the output of the executed command.

## TODO & Contribution

- [x] Generate a Template for the Implant
- [ ] Compile the implant as an .exe automatically
- [ ] Save the generated QR Code as bytes in a variable instead of a file - VICTIM Side
- [ ] Add an obfuscation on the commands decoded from the QR Codes automatically

Feel free to fork and contribute! Pull requests are welcome.
